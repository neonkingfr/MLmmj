README webinterface					Jun 27th 2004

Ehh, what's that?
   The mlmmj-webinterface was created to give people the opportunity to
{sub,unsub}scribe to your mailinglists without having to write an initial
{sub,unsub}scribe-mail, but only completing a form.


What are the requirements?
   Only a webserver, that has PHP >= 3.0.8 support.


How can I install/use the webinterface?
   - Upload webinterface/mlmmj.php to your webserver.
   - Have a look at webinterface/example.html and copy one or both forms
     and put them into your website.
   - Adjust the options to satisfy your needs:


      The mailinglist your want to {sub,unsub}scribe to:
      <input name="mailinglist" type="hidden" value="test@ct.kki.org">

      Do you want to subscribe or unsubscribe?
      <input name="job" type="hidden" value="subscribe">

     Where do you want to redirect your user after a failure? 
     <input name="redirect_failure" type="hidden" value="http://www.failure.com/">

     What should be the success redirect?
     <input name="redirect_success" type="hidden" value="http://www.success.com/">


That's it - have a fun!
