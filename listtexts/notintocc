Subject: Posts to $listaddr$ denied

Hi, this is the mlmmj program managing the mailinglist

$listaddr$

I'm sorry to inform you that Your mail could not be delivered to the
list.

In order to post to this list, the list address have to be contained
in either the To: or Cc: header.

If you are an admin of an mlmmj driven list, you should know that this
behaviour can be changed by touching the list control file 'tocc'.

Thanks.
