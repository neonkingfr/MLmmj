 o Convert mlmmj-sub, mlmmj-unsub and mlmmj-process (moderation) to use
   the new prepstdreply() function.
 o Add some more logging to mlmmj-maintd

Functionality items:
 o owner functionality
 o listname+get functionality
 o web interface

An ever ongoing TODO is we need someone to run it all through valgrind or
similar and plug all memory and fd leaks etc.
