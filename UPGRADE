This applies to everyone using mlmmj > 0.5.0:

 Note that listdir/subcribers is no longer used for subscribers. Instead
 every file in listdir/subscribers.d/ is used.

 A quick way to convert:

 $ for i in `cat listdir/subscribers` ; do mlmmj-sub -a $i -L listdir ; done

 And then remove listdir/subscribers.

 A quick and dirty hack would be to simply move listdir/subscribers into
 subscribers.d/. This could lead to double subscriptions, so use with caution!

 listdir/requeue/ directory have to be created
