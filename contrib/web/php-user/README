README webinterface					Jun 27th 2004

Ehh, what's that?
   The mlmmj-webinterface was created to give people the opportunity to
{sub,unsub}scribe to a mailinglists via a webinterface (without having to
write an initial {sub,unsub}scribe-mail).


What are the requirements?
   You only need a webserver with PHP >= 3.0.8 support.


How can I install/use the webinterface?
   - Upload mlmmj.php to your webserver.
   - Have a look at example.html and copy one or both forms
     into your website.
   - Adjust the options to satisfy your needs:

      The mailinglist your want to {sub,unsub}scribe to:
      <input name="mailinglist" type="hidden" value="mlmmj-test@example.org">

      Do you want to subscribe or unsubscribe?
      <input name="job" type="hidden" value="subscribe">

      Where do you want to redirect your user after a failure? 
      <input name="redirect_failure" type="hidden" value="http://www.failure.com/">

      What should be the success redirect?
      <input name="redirect_success" type="hidden" value="http://www.success.com/">


That's it - have a lot of fun!
