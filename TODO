Code cleanup:
 o Add some more logging to mlmmj-maintd--actually we have to rethink logging a
   bit. Do we want to use our own /var/log/mlmmj

Functionality items:
 o Make mlmmj-maintd capable of running maintenance on all listdirs in a
   directory
 o Move subject into the text files, so we can make the lists any language we
   want.
 o control/preexec and control/postexec.

Nice to do:
 o Convert mlmmj-sub, mlmmj-unsub and mlmmj-process (moderation) to use
   the new prepstdreply() function.
 o Add memory debugging features ("At exit you had the following allocated:")
