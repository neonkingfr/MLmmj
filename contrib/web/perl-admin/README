To use this web-interface you have to:

1) Copy the files into your webroot, preferably in a sub-directory.

2) Change the permissions of the listdir/control directories of any list you
   want to control using the web-interface, so the web server can write in it:

     # chown -R wwwrun /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/control/


To enable access control on Apache you have to:

3) Rename dot.htaccess to .htaccess.

4) Rename dot.htpasswd to .htpasswd and remove the default login (admin:mlmmj)
   from it. Then run

     $ htpasswd .htpasswd USER

   to add the login "USER" to the access file.

5) That is it, you are ready to use the interface.
