   for spotting.
0.8.1
 o Go through all open() calls and retry in case we (allthough it's extremely
   unlikely) did get EEXIST
 o Add the option to add a To: header including the recipient emailaddress.
   NOTE that this does not remove any existing To: headers, they should be
   removed in control/delheaders

   de-quoted printable version of the Subject. If so, don't add it.

   bouncing.
 o Don't litter the queuedirectory with files when rejecting mails (the
   maintenance daemon would take care of it, but lets be nice)
0.8.0

 o Added wrappers for malloc(), realloc(), free() and strdup(), so we can
   bail out if any of them fail.

 o Add a macro to make sure mlmmj binaries are invoked with full path
 o Add the function to mlmmj-maintd to unsubscribe people who've been bouncing
   for BOUNCELIFE (default 432000 sec, 5 days) time. This completes
   the bouncehandling of mlmmj. SIC!
 o Add logging to mlmmj-maintd. mlmmj-maintd.lastrun.log in the listdir
   always has the log of the last run. This is work in progress.

   control/ so move them there

 o Also mmap the subscribers file when reading subcribers
 o Do an mmap of the mail to send once, instead of reading the mail for
   each mail to send
 o Rip out the ability to fork to make more than one connection to relayhost.
   It turned out to not make any performance gain (tested with lists with
   more than 120000 subscribers), and thus only complicated things.
   KISS won, so it's gone.
 o mlmmj-maint now handles resends and cleanup
 o Fixed interrupted fgets() in write_mailbody_from_file()
 o Fixed leak of subfile in mlmmj-send
0.5.2

   they belong

   here means moving them to queue/discard

   will now fork for each file (up to MAX_CONNECTIONS) for faster delivery.
   mlmmj-unsub will search for subscribers in all of these files.
   mlmmj-sub will now add emailaddresses to the file in subscribers.d/ with
   the name of the first character in the emailaddress (foo@bar.com will be
   in subscribers.d/f).

   functionality (touch listdir/control/closedlist and it's closed)

0.3.4
 o Fix handling of lines which start with a dot
0.3.3
