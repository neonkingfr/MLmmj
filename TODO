Code cleanup:
 o Make RECIPDELIM configurable (compile and/or runtime)
 o Add some more logging to mlmmj-maintd--actually we have to rethink logging a
   bit. We want to log everything to syslog/mlmmj.

Functionality items:
 o control/preexec and control/postexec.

Nice to do:
 o Add memory debugging features ("At exit you had the following allocated:")
