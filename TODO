Code cleanup:
 o Add malloc and realloc macros that will exit(EXIT_FAILURE) if malloc or
   realloc fails
 o Convert opening of write files to openrandexclrw
 o Add some more logging to mlmmj-maintd

Functionality items:
 o listname+get functionality
 o web interface
 o listdir/control/access for regexp access control of mail to the list

Nice to do:
 o Convert mlmmj-sub, mlmmj-unsub and mlmmj-process (moderation) to use
   the new prepstdreply() function.
 o Add memory debugging features ("At exit you had the following allocated")
