TUNABLES for lists managed with mlmmj:
--------------------------------------

The following files can be used for changing the behaviour of a list. The
filename is supposed to be below listdir/control. In the case it's a "boolean",
the contents of a file does not matter, the mere presence of it, will set the
variable to "true". If it's a "normal" file, the first line will be used as
value, leaving line 2 and forward ready for commentary etc.

 · closedlist			(boolean)

   Is the list is open or closed. If it's closed subscribtion and
   unsubscription via mail is disabled. Also note that confirmation is disabled
   too, so the -C option to mlmmj-sub and mlmmj-unsub is of no use with a
   closed list.

 · moderated			(boolean)

   If this file is present, the emailaddresses in the file listdir/moderators
   will act as moderators for the list.

 · prefix			(normal)

   The prefix for the Subject: line of mails to the list. This will alter the
   Subject: line, and add a prefix if it's not present elsewhere.
