1.0.0-RC3
 o Add web-interface (PHP). Thank you Christoph Thiel
 o Have the random numbers be somewhat longer everywhere and not just somewhere
 o Move free() to where it belongs fixing problems with mlmmj-process some
   people have been seen
 o Fix printing of cron entry in mlmmj-make-ml.sh
1.0.0-RC2
 o Do not allow mails from <> going to the list
 o Fix mailing to +owner again by adding missing 'break;' to switch in
   mlmmj-send
 o perl-admin updates from Christian Laursen

1.0.0-RC1
 o Add web-interface. Thanks Christian Laursen for new perl-admin
 o Dump the customheaders before any Mime headers
 o Implement +get-N functionality, so it's possible to send a mail to
   foolist+get-101@domain.tld to retrieve mail 101 from that list. It's
   deliberately only possible to request one mail at a time.
 o Make sure that only either root or the listdir owner can execute the
   binaries when it has something to do with lists.
 o Don't leave bounces-help@ mails lying around in queue/
 o Remove unanchored ".*" from beginning of regexp
0.8.3
 o Have mlmmj-make-ml.sh remind people about using cron if they want
 o Replying to the confirmation address is enough to sub/unsub, no matter what
   address is used the second time
 o Fix possible DoS wrt. unsubscribing. Thank you Erik Toubro Nielsen
 o Add 'notifysub' functionality to have owner know when people sub/unsub.
   Thank you Kenneth Vestergaard Schmidt
 o Use Return-Path: for envelope From. Thanks Anders Johansson
 o Specification of which relayhost to use can now be done in control/relayhost
 o Add configure check to link against libnsl if needed.
 o Implement our own daemon() function since we don't have daemon() on Solaris
0.8.2
 o Make sure we don't cut of the first char of an emailaddress
 o Fix header value copying (thanks Anders Johansson)
 o Don't segfault if there's no email address in the To: header
 o Clean up the subconf and unsubconf directories for stale requests as well
0.8.1.1
 o Fix bug with prepstdreply not opening correct file. Thanks Christian Laursen
   for spotting.
0.8.1
 o Go through all open() calls and retry in case we (allthough it's extremely
   unlikely) did get EEXIST
 o Add the option to add a To: header including the recipient emailaddress.
   NOTE that this does not remove any existing To: headers, they should be
   removed in control/delheaders
 o Optimize mlmmj-send by preparing the mail in memory to reduce the amount of
   write syscalls. control/memmailsize (size in bytes) controls how big it can
   be. Default is 16k before it's send line by line.
 o Make sure we check if the Subject: prefix might be present in the
   de-quoted printable version of the Subject. If so, don't add it.
 o Fix bug with queuefilename not being correctly initialized when generating
   standard mails
 o Let mlmmj-send be capable of handling relayhost local users bounce probes
   bouncing.
 o Don't litter the queuedirectory with files when rejecting mails (the
   maintenance daemon would take care of it, but lets be nice)
0.8.0
 o Added regular expression based access control.
 o Added wrappers for malloc(), realloc(), free() and strdup(), so we can
   bail out if any of them fail.
0.7.3
 o Implement control/delheaders in where one can specify all the headers
   to delete in incoming mail to the list.
 o Add +owner functionality (control/owner). Several addresses possible.
 o Relicense the whole thing to be MIT instead of GPL
0.7.2
 o Make it possible to only let subscribers post
 o Implement feature to deny posts where the listaddress is not in To: or
   Cc:. Enabled pr. default, but can be disabled by touching control/tocc
 o Make mlmmj-sub change uid to the owner of listdir to avoid permission
   problems. Disable with -U to mlmmj-sub.
 o More memory debugging
0.7.1
 o Fix bug with .reciptto and .mailfrom getting swapped
 o Plug a few small memory leaks in mlmmj-maintd
 o Fix bug with maintenance logfile not being opened at the right spot
0.7.0
 o Add a macro to make sure mlmmj binaries are invoked with full path
 o Add the function to mlmmj-maintd to unsubscribe people who've been bouncing
   for BOUNCELIFE (default 432000 sec, 5 days) time. This completes
   the bouncehandling of mlmmj. SIC!
 o Add logging to mlmmj-maintd. mlmmj-maintd.lastrun.log in the listdir
   always has the log of the last run. This is work in progress.
 o Make mlmmj-bounce capable of sending probes
 o Include a function for easy generation of standard mail replies
0.6.0
 o Add several unlinks. No need to litter queue/ with useless files
 o Don't use moderation/queue for outgoing, just use queue/
 o Christoph Thiel pointed out that listaddress and moderators belong in
   control/ so move them there
 o Get rid of all FILE * instances and replace them with fd's
 o Also mmap the subscribers file when reading subcribers
 o Do an mmap of the mail to send once, instead of reading the mail for
   each mail to send
 o Rip out the ability to fork to make more than one connection to relayhost.
   It turned out to not make any performance gain (tested with lists with
   more than 120000 subscribers), and thus only complicated things.
   KISS won, so it's gone.
 o mlmmj-maint now handles resends and cleanup
 o Fixed interrupted fgets() in write_mailbody_from_file()
 o Fixed leak of subfile in mlmmj-send
0.5.2
 o footer and customheaders are now accessed from listdir/control/ where
   they belong
 o Discard mails that doesn't have one and only one From: address. Discard
   here means moving them to queue/discard
 o Make sure we retrieve info from all headers matching the token we want
 o Fixed error handling in mlmmj-send if we can not open subscribers.d/
 o Make mlmmj-send a lot more robust with SMTP and handle
   bounces from the relayhost.
 o Fix BUG in mlmmj-bounce still using listdir/subscribers
 o Handle subconf/unsubconf bounces
 o Begin work on mlmmj-maintd--the mlmmj maintenance daemon
 o Make help consistent and up to date with all options

   mlmmj-send process) option in mlmmj.h
 o Fixed error handling in mlmmj-unsub if we can not open subscribers.d/
0.5.0
 o Use a subscribers.d/ directory for several subscribers files. mlmmj-send
   will now fork for each file (up to MAX_CONNECTIONS) for faster delivery.
   mlmmj-unsub will search for subscribers in all of these files.
   mlmmj-sub will now add emailaddresses to the file in subscribers.d/ with
   the name of the first character in the emailaddress (foo@bar.com will be
   in subscribers.d/f).
 o Major cleanup of listcontrol() and in the process add closed list
   functionality (touch listdir/control/closedlist and it's closed)
0.4.0
 o Add moderation functionality
0.3.4
 o Fix handling of lines which start with a dot
0.3.3

 o mlmmj-recieve now forks before exec()
 o mlmmj-{,un}sub now uses mmap and friends for better performance
0.3.2
 o Logging enhancement
 o Send on the full path to the binaries around in the program since
   execlp needs it.
 o Make mlmmj-make-ml.sh use /bin/sh not /bin/bash
 o Rename mlmmj-{subscribe,unsubscribe} to mlmmj-{sub,unsub}

 o Make the random_int() function work without /dev/random, which is not
   present on DEC-Unix/Tru64 (mortenp)
 o Make -V print the version
0.2.1
 o Make the From: header on sub/unsub mails be listname+help
 o Double check the subscription address before adding.
 o The From header should be generated according to archive in the list mails

 o Small bugfixes
0.2.0
 o Implement subscription and unsubscription by email

   mailinglist directory
 o Make use of a queue directory, and not move mails to the archive before they
   are processed by mlmmj-send.

 o Properly handle the replies from the mailserver on our requests. Still need
   some kind of requeing mechanism though.

0.1.3
 o Make it write \r\n for each \n.
 o Convert everything possible to snprintf
 o Make valgrind (http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/) find no error, leaks
   anything

 o Made mlmmj-subscribe
 o Fix the indexnumber in the From header. Was reversed.
0.1.1
