This only applies if you used mlmmj before version 0.3.0
---------------------------------------------------------
If you don't have a help file in listdir/text/listhelp there is one in
listtexts/listhelp, which can be installed by doing:
$ install -m 644 listtexts/listhelp /path/to/mylist/text


This only applies if you used mlmmj before version 0.2.0:
---------------------------------------------------------

Starting with mlmmj-0.2.0, it is no longer necessary to specify the listaddress
on the commandline. See the README for how the aliases look, or simply just
remove the -l <listaddr> switch.

Also starting with mlmmj-0.2.0, there is a need to extend the mailinglist
directory. Have a look in the README and in the mlmmj-make-ml.sh script, but
basically this should do it:

$ mkdir /path/to/mylist/{queue,text,subconf,unsubconf}
$ install -m 644 listtexts/* /path/to/mylist/text
