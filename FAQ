Q: How does people subscribe/unsubscribe to mlmmj controlled mailinglists?
A: They send a mail to listname+subscribe@domain.tld or
   listname+unsubscribe@domain.tld. So if we had a list called jokes@humour.org
   people would send a mail to jokes+subscribe@humour.org to subscribe and
   jokes+unsubscribe@humour.org to unsubscribe

Q: Why is my queue/ in the listdirectory filled with files with cryptip names
   such as '4b35160eee7f63d' '287e3509509e4577' and '49123e175f68fcbc'
A: mlmmj had a tendency of leaking files in the queue/ in the past. They're
   safe to delete as long as they're not accompanied by .from and .rcptto files
