README mlmmj-0.3.2					April 23st 2004

This is my attempt at implementing a mailing list manager with the same
functionality as the brilliant ezmlm, but with a decent license and mail server
independency.

The functionality is still quite limited:

 · Subscribe / unsubscribe functionality (email, commandline).
 · Archive
 · Custom headers / footer

Next feature in the works is bouncehandling--it's not _as_ urgent as it seems,
since the mailserver delivering the mails takes care of most of it. This
feature missing should not keep you from using mlmmj on not that heavy
trafficated list.

To use mlmmj, do the following:

1) Make sure your mailserver accepts '+' as a recipient delimiter. With Postfix
   it's done by adding

   	recipient_delimiter = +

   to /etc/postfix/main.cf.

   There is a nice FAQ explaining here: http://faqs.org/faqs/mail/addressing/

2) Create the mailinglist.  There's a script, mlmmj-make-ml.sh, that will make
   a mailinglist for mlmmj. It is highly recommended to use this script to make
   the lists! What is does is described here:

   In the case of a list called mlmmj-test below /var/spool/mlmmj it makes the
   following directories:

   /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/{incoming,queue,archive,text,subconf,unsubconf}

   And creates files similar to the ones in the listtexts/ directory of the
   source distribution in /var/spool/mlmmj/text/.

   NOTE: The mailinglist directory have to be owned by the user the mailserver
   writes as. On some Postfix installations Postfix is run by the user postfix,
   but still writes files as nobody:nogroup or nobody:nobody

3) Make the changes to your mailserver aliases that came as output from
   mlmmj-make-ml.sh. Following the example above they will look like this:

   mlmmj-test:     | "/usr/bin/mlmmj-recieve -L /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test"
   mlmmj-test-bounces: postmaster

   Assuming postmaster should get the list bounces (yes, bouncehandling is the 
   next major feature that will be added to mlmmj).

   NOTE: Don't forget newaliases.

That's it! You might want to go through the next steps too.

4) Subscribe some people

   mlmmj-subscribe -L /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/ -a joe@domain.tld

   etc.

   NOTE: Don't forget to make correct permissions on the subscribers file
   if you don't perform all list actions as the user that writes mail.

5) If you want custom headers like X-Mailinglist, Reply-To: etc. just add a
   file called 'customheaders' in the list directory like this:
   $ cat /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/customheaders
   X-Mailinglist: mlmmj-test
   Reply-To: mlmmj-test@domain.ltd

6) If you want every mail to have something like:
   -- 
   To unsubscribe send a mail to coollist+unsubscribe@lists.domain.net

   Just add what you want to a file named "footer" in the same dir as
   "customheader".


Ah, I almost forgot; If you want to use something else than localhost for your
maildelivery you have to change it in include/mlmmj.h before compiling.

Have a fun!
