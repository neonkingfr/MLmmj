Subject: Confirm subscription to nomail version of $listaddr$

Hi, this is the mlmmj program managing the mailinglist

$listaddr$

To confirm you want the address

$subaddr$

added to the nomail[1] version of this list, please send a reply to

$confaddr$

This confirmation serves two purposes. It tests that mail can be sent to
your address. Secondly it makes sure someone else did not try and
subscribe your emailaddress without you wanting it.

Your mailer probably automatically replies to the confirmation address,
when you hit the reply button.

The subject and the body of the mail can be anything.

[1] nomail version means that you are a subscriber to the list without
    getting any posts to the list.
