mlmmj-recieve-strip is a replacement for mlmmj-recieve

It opens the files control/mimedeny and control/mimestrip to get a list of mimetypes
for parts of multipart/mime messages that should be denied or stripped

The parts then get stripped directly when the mail is recieved.

mlmmj-recieve-strip also appends an extra header

X-ThisMailContainsUnwantedMimeParts: Y when the mail contains unwanted mime parts


Usage:
Compile the program in this directory with make and use "make install" to install it.
Afterwards replace mlmmj-receive with mlmmj-receive-strip in /etc/aliases for the mailinglist
you want to enable stripping and run newaliases


Then create the files mimedeny mimestrip in the control directory of your mailinglist.

If control/mimestrip for example contains:

text/html
application/octet-stream

html texts and binarys will be stripped from the mail.

When you also want to deny mails with certain mimeparts add the mimetypes to the mimedeny file
and add the following lines to the control/access file:

deny ^X-ThisMailContainsUnwantedMimeParts: Y
allow

You will most likely want to remove the X-ThisMailContainsUnwantedMimeParts
header by adding the following line to the control/delheaders file:

X-ThisMailContainsUnwantedMimeParts:
