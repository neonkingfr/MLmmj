Subject: Confirm subscription to digest of $listaddr$

Hi, this is the mlmmj program managing the mailinglist

$listaddr$

To confirm you want the address

$subaddr$

added to the digest of this list, please send a reply to

$confaddr$

This confirmation serves two purposes. It tests that mail can be sent to
your address. Secondly it makes sure someone else did not try and
subscribe your emailaddress without you wanting it.

Your mailer probably automatically replies to the confirmation address,
when you hit the reply button.

The subject and the body of the mail can be anything.
