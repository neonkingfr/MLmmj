Hi, this is the mlmmj program managing the mailinglist

*LSTADDR*


To confirm you want the address

*SUBADDR*


added to the nomail version of this list, please send a reply to

*CNFADDR*


You are getting this mail because of two possible scenarios:

1) You want to be subscribed to the list without getting any mail from it,
   because you have other means of reading it, and have sent an email
   specifically to subscribe

2) You have tried to post to a list that only allows posting from sub-
   scribers. In this case simply reply to this mail, and you will be
   able to post to the list with this emailaddress in the future

Your mailer probably automatically replies to this address, when you hit
the reply button.

This confirmation serves two purposes. It tests that mail can be sent to your
address. Second, it makes sure someone else did not try and subscribe your
emailaddress.
