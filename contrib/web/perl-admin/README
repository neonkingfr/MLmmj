mlmmj-1.0.0                                                  August 20th 2004

To use this web-interface you have to:

0) Make sure you have the CGI::FastTemplate perl module installed. If not, then
   install it. It has no dependencies to other perl modules.

1) Copy the files from the perl-admin directory of the mlmmj distribution to a
   suitable location and point your webroot to the htdocs directory. If you
   don't want the webinterface in the root of your website it is recommended to
   make an alias in your web server configuration in order to keep the conf
   directory at the same level as the htdocs directory and still outside
   webscope.

2) You need to enable cgi in your apache configuration like this

      Options ExecCGI
      DirectoryIndex index.cgi
      AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

3) Change the permissions of the listdir/control directories of any list you
   want to control using the web-interface, so the web server can write in it:

     # chown -R wwwrun /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/control/

4) If the web server does not run as the same user the mailserver writes as
   you need to create a group (eg. mlmmj) and add both users to it. The
   subscribers.d directory then needs to be writable by that group:

     # chgrp -R mlmmj /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/subscribers.d
     # chmod -R g+w /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/subscribers.d
     # chgrp -R mlmmj /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/digesters.d
     # chmod -R g+w /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/digesters.d
     # chgrp -R mlmmj /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/nomailsubs.d
     # chmod -R g+w /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/nomailsubs.d
     # chgrp -R mlmmj /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/text
     # chmod -R g+w /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/text

To enable access control on Apache you have to:

5) Rename dot.htaccess to .htaccess and edit the path inside the file to point
   to a htpasswd file somewhere outside the webscope.

   If you don't have one already, you can create one like this

      htpasswd -c /home/mlmmj/htpasswd USER

   It will then ask you for a password for the given username.

6) That is it, you are ready to use the interface.

Further customization:

You can set two environment variables in your apache config to control the
configuration of the mlmmj webinterface. Remember to have mod_env loaded if
you do this.

   SetEnv CONFIG_PATH /home/mlmmj/conf/config.pl
   SetEnv TUNABLES_PATH /home/mlmmj/conf/tunables.pl

This allows you to run several instances of the webinterface with e.g. different
topdirs, translated to another language or with another layout.
