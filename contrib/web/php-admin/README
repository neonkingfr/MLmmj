mlmmj-1.0.0                                                  August 31th 2004

To use this web-interface you have to:

1) Copy the files from the php-admin directory of the mlmmj distribution to a
   suitable location and point your webroot to the htdocs directory. If you
   don't want the webinterface in the root of your website it is recommended to
   make an alias in your web server configuration in order to keep the conf
   directory at the same level as the htdocs directory and still outside
   webscope.

2) Change the permissions of the listdir/control directories of any list you
   want to control using the web-interface, so the web server can write in it:

     # chown -R wwwrun /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/control/

To enable access control on Apache you have to:

3) Rename dot.htaccess to .htaccess and edit the path inside the file to point
   to a htpasswd file somewhere outside the webscope.

   If you don't have one already, you can create one like this

      htpasswd -c /home/mlmmj/htpasswd USER

   It will then ask you for a password for the given username.

4) That is it, you are ready to use the interface.
