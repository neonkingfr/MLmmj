 Updating the list texts is optional but highly recommended, as they have been
 vastly improved for this version.

 Users of the php-admin interface need to modify configuration files to define
 $confdir.

 Be aware of the following new features you may wish to turn on or use:

- Richer list texts (including a new naming scheme, conditionals, automatic
  wrapping and true UTF-8 support). See README.listtexts for more details.
- Notifying posters when their posts are being moderated (notifymod tunable).
- Not-me-too feature to avoid having the poster receiving their own messages
  (notmetoo tunable).
- Ability to explicitly reject posts (exposed in new list texts).
- Ability to explicitly obstruct subscriptions (exposed in new list texts).
- Unsubscribe from all versions of a list at once (changed behaviour of
  +unsubscribe[-{digest|nomail}]; they now all remove the subscriber from all
  versions of the list).
- Ability to switch between different versions of a list by using
  +subscribe[-{digest|nomail|both}] ('both' means normal and digest, and is a
  'hidden feature' not mentioned in the supplied list texts).
- Subscription ability in php-admin.

This applies to everyone using mlmmj < 1.1.0:
---------------------------------------------

 Don't forget to upgrade the listtexts. Listtext handling was
 completely rewritten and the subject is now translateable as well.

 Don't forget to create the new directories needed for digest and
 nomail version of the list. listdir/subcribers.d and listdir/nomailsubs.d

This applies to everyone using mlmmj < 0.8.3:
---------------------------------------------

 Don't forget to upgrade the listtexts!

This applies to everyone using mlmmj > 0.7.2:
